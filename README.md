[Project 1: User next purchase prediction](https://github.com/Cathy-Z1900/User-next-purchase-prediction)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please click the link above for details.<br>

This project is machine leanring model used for predicting user’s next purchase based on user’s individual features and item features.<br>
The prediction model is based on transformer architecture (multi-head self-attention mechanism) to learn user action representation. RMSE and mse is used to evaluate the model performance.<br>

[Project 2: Aspect-based sentiment analysis](https://github.com/Cathy-Z1900/NLP-task-user-reviews)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
