[Project 1: User next purchase prediction](https://github.com/Cathy-Z1900/User-next-purchase-prediction)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please click the link above for details.<br>
This project is in proceeding of conference <br>
This project is machine leanring model used for predicting user’s next purchase based on user’s individual features and item features.<br>
The prediction model is based on transformer architecture (multi-head self-attention mechanism) to learn user action representation. RMSE and mse is used to evaluate the model performance.<br>

This project is used to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis using public dataset from Amazon user review. It helps to extract user opinion according to different topics of user review. For componens are included in the project:Data preprocessing, topic modeling, dependency parsing and sentiment analysis.Apply Explanable AI for user intention prediction and explanation.

[Project 3(publication): User Analytics Solution for Microservices-based Software ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10020831)

This article has been published in 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)<br>
this project presents a user analytic sotlution in distributed microservice based enviornment. Machine learning methods are used to predict usage patterns which are generated from interaction between user and system. <br>
1. Design an innovative solution to carry out user analytics based on monitoring microservice-based distributed software applications.<br> 
2. Perform real-time predictions based on multiple machine learning algorithms to generate early alarms for possible errors that may occur in the near future during the execution of software applications.
